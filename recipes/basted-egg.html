        <h5>
            This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and <st>a creamy, runny yolk</st>. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.
        </h5>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 ½ tablespoons salted butter </li>
            <li> 2 large eggs </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon water </li>
            <li> ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste </li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. </li>
            <li>Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li> 
            <li>Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate.</li> 
            <li>Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
